# Customer Segments – Definitions & Analytical Use

Customer segmentation helps understand purchasing behavior, logistics expectations, and profitability differences across groups. The DataCo dataset includes the following segment:

## 1. Consumer

**Characteristics:**
- Highly price-sensitive; responds strongly to discounts.
- Lower average order quantity compared to B2B segments.
- Expect faster delivery and transparent tracking.
- Often spread across diverse geographic regions.

**Operational Implications:**
- Requires strong last-mile logistics performance.
- Promotional pricing significantly affects sales and volume.

## 2. Corporate
Businesses purchasing in moderate-to-large quantities for office or resale use.

**Characteristics:**
- Larger average order size.
- More predictable reorder cycles.
- Medium sensitivity to discounts.
- Higher expectations for service reliability.

**Operational Implications:**
- Delivery reliability (on_time_delivery) is critical.

## 3. Home Office
Small businesses or freelancers operating out of residential locations.

**Characteristics:**
- Small quantity orders but more frequent.
- Moderate to high sensitivity to delays.
- Mix of both consumer-like and corporate-like behavior.

**Operational Implications:**
